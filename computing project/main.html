        Stay Responsible! Follow the school rules to be a Victorious Leader in Christ ✨

    <p>At Elyon Christian School, students are expected to follow all school rules. If a student breaks the rules, there are certain steps and consequences to help them learn from their mistakes. This process is called <strong>Consequences and Mentoring</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Types of Offenses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mild Offenses</li>
        <li>Moderate Offenses</li>
        <li>Severe Offenses</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Mild Offenses:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Coming late to class.</li>
        <li>Eating in class without permission.</li>
        <li>Using your phone during lessons.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When a student makes small mistakes (like being late or forgetting materials), teachers usually give a warning or a red slip. If the same behavior keeps happening, there will be more serious consequences, like community service or parent meetings.</p>

    <h3>Mentoring and Guidance</h3>
    <p>Students who get in trouble are not punished to be hurt but to help them grow. Teachers and mentors guide them to make better choices next time. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Talking with a mentor or counselor</li>
        <li>Doing community service</li>
        <li>Reporting regularly to the Vice Principal of Student Affairs</li>
    </ul>
